# Habit Reward README
An app that pairs a desired action/habit with a converted reward action. 

Add an action to the database that you would like to make into a habit. Then, pair this action with a reward action. Lastly, create a conversion rate between the two actions. Once you spend time doing the Habit Action, you can input the time spent, and the app will automatically use your conversion to reward you Reward Action Points!

Example:

A user decides they would like to work on personal projects more, so they add "Personal Projects" as a Habit Action. 

They also love to play video games, and would like to regulate their time spent playing a bit more, so they add that as the paired Reward Action with Personal Projects.

They decide they would like to motivate themselves quite a bit, so they choose a 1:2 conversion rate, which means for every hour they spend working on personal projects, they will be rewarded two hours of video game time.
